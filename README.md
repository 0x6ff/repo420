# repo666.ultrasn0w.uk - a parody of the old ultrasn0w repo

![New Project (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59025363/208972758-b11fbcbf-7a00-4eaa-b75c-0b013ef14955.png)




This repository is an attempt of a remake of AFRIOS, as-in attempting to fix several package manager download and view issues.
Thanks to this succeeding, we now primarily host tweaks, applications, and bootloopers, but also with package managers.
Including but not limited to: Setup, Cheyote ETA Checker, Sileo, YouTube Reborn, etc.
